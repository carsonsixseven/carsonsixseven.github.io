    "text": "When we think of pitchers in baseball, our minds correlate a good pitcher with a low ERA with wins. Wins is a weird stat in baseball. According to the rule book of Major League Baseball “a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings (in a traditional game of nine innings or longer) to qualify for the win”. But there’s a catch “A pitcher receives a win when he is the pitcher of record when his team takes the lead for good”.\nTo put things in simpler terms, a starting pitcher can only get the win if they pitch at least 5 innings AND have offensive support with a lead when they exit the game… AND your team must hold on to the lead for the rest of the game once you exit.\nSo not only does a starting pitcher’s win statistic rely on his offense to first off score more runs than the other team while he’s pitching, the relief pitchers after him have to record a hold on the opposition.\nLet’s look at Baseball’s finest from the 2024 season. And how their wins and ERA compare.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 242 Columns: 38\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): Player, Team, Lg, Awards, Player-additional\ndbl (33): Rk, Age, WAR, W, L, W-L%, ERA, G, GS, GF, CG, SHO, SV, IP, H, R, E...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\ntop_era &lt;- pitching %&gt;%\n  filter(GS &gt;= 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ERA) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 30)\nggplot(top_era, aes(x = ERA, y = W)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray39\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"ERA vs Wins — Top 30 Pitchers (≥20 GS)\",\n    x = \"Earned Run Average (ERA)\",\n    y = \"Total Wins\",\n    caption = \"Filtered for pitchers with at least 20 games started\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeird. Now what if we grouped pitchers by their ERA and found the median number of wins for each ERA group on a box plot? Is there a correlation? Does having a lower ERA mean you’ll actually get more wins for your team?\n\n\nCode\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in the pitching data\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\")\n\n# Filter to pitchers with at least 20 GS and select top 100 by lowest ERA\npitching_filtered &lt;- pitching %&gt;%\n  filter(GS &gt;= 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ERA) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 100)\n\n# Create ERA group categories and order them correctly\npitching_filtered &lt;- pitching_filtered %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ERA_Group = case_when(\n      ERA &lt;= 2.5 ~ \"&lt;= 2.5\",\n      ERA &gt; 2.5 & ERA &lt;= 3.0 ~ \"2.51–3.00\",\n      ERA &gt; 3.0 & ERA &lt;= 3.5 ~ \"3.01–3.50\",\n      ERA &gt; 3.5 ~ \"&gt; 3.50\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    ERA_Group = factor(\n      ERA_Group,\n      levels = c(\"&lt;= 2.5\", \"2.51–3.00\", \"3.01–3.50\", \"&gt; 3.50\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ERA_Group))\n\n# Calculate median Wins per ERA group\nera_medians &lt;- pitching_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(ERA_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(median_wins = median(W, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Create the boxplot\nggplot(pitching_filtered, aes(x = ERA_Group, y = W, fill = ERA_Group)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6, outlier.color = \"gray60\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = era_medians,\n    aes(x = ERA_Group, y = median_wins),\n    color = \"red\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = era_medians,\n    aes(x = ERA_Group, y = median_wins, label = round(median_wins, 1)),\n    vjust = -1,\n    color = \"red\",\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Wins by ERA Group — Top 100 Pitchers (≥20 GS)\",\n    x = \"ERA Range\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    caption = \"Red points indicate median Wins per ERA group\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Wins Based on ERA\n\n\n\n\nOkay, maybe they do correlate.

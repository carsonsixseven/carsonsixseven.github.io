My appreciation for baseball is biased, but I think the dynamic of how the team is important but only to a certain degree. And the experiences and success of a pitcher can change and vary based on their team."

    "text": "When we think of pitchers in baseball, our minds correlate a good pitcher with a low ERA with wins. Wins is a weird stat in baseball. According to the rule book of Major League Baseball “a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings (in a traditional game of nine innings or longer) to qualify for the win”. But there’s a catch “A pitcher receives a win when he is the pitcher of record when his team takes the lead for good”.\nTo put things in simpler terms, a starting pitcher can only get the win if they pitch at least 5 innings AND have offensive support with a lead when they exit the game… AND your team must hold on to the lead for the rest of the game once you exit.\nSo not only does a starting pitcher’s win statistic rely on his offense to first off score more runs than the other team while he’s pitching, the relief pitchers after him have to record a hold on the opposition.\nLet’s look at Baseball’s finest from the 2024 season. And how their wins and ERA compare.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\")\ntop_era &lt;- pitching %&gt;%\n  filter(GS &gt;= 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ERA) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 30)\nggplot(top_era, aes(x = ERA, y = W)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray39\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"MLB's 30 best starters ERA and how many wins they earned.\" ,\n    x = \"Earned Run Average (ERA)\",\n    y = \"Total Wins\",\n    caption = \"By: Carson Jasa\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeird. Now what if we grouped pitchers by their ERA and found the median number of wins for each ERA group on a box plot? Is there a correlation? Does having a lower ERA mean you’ll actually get more wins for your team?\n\n\nCode\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Read in the pitching data\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\")\n\n# Filter to pitchers with at least 20 GS and select top 100 by lowest ERA\npitching_filtered &lt;- pitching %&gt;%\n  filter(GS &gt;= 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ERA) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 100)\n\n# Create ERA group categories and order them correctly\npitching_filtered &lt;- pitching_filtered %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ERA_Group = case_when(\n      ERA &lt;= 2.5 ~ \"&lt;= 2.5\",\n      ERA &gt; 2.5 & ERA &lt;= 3.0 ~ \"2.51–3.00\",\n      ERA &gt; 3.0 & ERA &lt;= 3.5 ~ \"3.01–3.50\",\n      ERA &gt; 3.5 ~ \"&gt; 3.50\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    ERA_Group = factor(\n      ERA_Group,\n      levels = c(\"&lt;= 2.5\", \"2.51–3.00\", \"3.01–3.50\", \"&gt; 3.50\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ERA_Group))\n\n# Calculate median Wins per ERA group\nera_medians &lt;- pitching_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(ERA_Group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(median_wins = median(W, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Create the boxplot\nggplot(pitching_filtered, aes(x = ERA_Group, y = W, fill = ERA_Group)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6, outlier.color = \"gray60\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = era_medians,\n    aes(x = ERA_Group, y = median_wins),\n    color = \"red\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = era_medians,\n    aes(x = ERA_Group, y = median_wins, label = round(median_wins, 1)),\n    vjust = -1,\n    color = \"red\",\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"What is the median number of wins players should expect based on their ERA.\",\n    x = \"ERA Range\",\n    y = \"Wins\",\n    caption = \"Median win value represented by red point.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Wins Based on ERA\n\n\n\n\nOkay, maybe they do correlate. Baseball isn’t so random after all, MOST players that pitched under a 2.5 ERA saw the wins stacking up? But what about the BIG dogs- the Cy Young finalists? Did their wins align with their ERA? Or was there some misfortune?\n\n\nCode\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# Read the pitching data\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\")\n\n# Filter for pitchers with at least 20 GS and get top 10 by ERA\ntop10_pitchers &lt;- pitching %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ERA), !is.na(W), GS &gt;= 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ERA) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Reshape data for slope chart\nslope_data &lt;- top10_pitchers %&gt;%\n  select(Player, ERA, W) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(ERA, W), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n# Create a label column that combines player name + ERA\nslope_data &lt;- slope_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(top10_pitchers %&gt;% select(Player, ERA), by = \"Player\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(label_text = paste0(Player, \" (ERA: \", round(ERA, 2), \")\"))\n\n# Create slope chart\nggplot(slope_data, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, group = Player, color = Player)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  \n  # Label with Player name + ERA on the Wins side\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = slope_data %&gt;% filter(Metric == \"W\"),\n    aes(label = label_text),\n    hjust = -0.2,\n    size = 3.5,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_x_discrete(position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How does it look for the game's elite?\",\n    subtitle = \"Next to each line is the player it represents and their ERA for the season.\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Value\",\n    caption = \"Player label includes ERA value\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  ) +\n  xlim(\"ERA\", \"W\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope Chart Comparing ERA and Wins for Top 10 Pitchers (≥20 GS) — ERA Value Shown in Label\n\n\n\n\nThis may be my favorite plot. I think as a pitcher myself, it’s interesting to see who’s making their ERA stand up and getting wins for their team, and who’s maybe seen some misfortune, regardless of individual triumph. Like my guy Paul."
